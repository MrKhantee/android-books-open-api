# OpenBooksApi


## Introduction


In addition to my Java/Spring expertize and as a proud owner of Android OS smart phone, I was always
tempted to learn and write some application for Android. Year ago I even bought a Android book
[Beginning Android 4 Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-4-Application-Development/dp/1118199545/ref=asap_B001ITVV1E_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1417025391&sr=1-1)
by Wei-Meng Lee.
I was starting reading this book couple of times, went over few chapters and as you know this, Android programming was not my
primary every-day work, I was loosing focus from Android.
And then I found about Coursera.org. It was just what I needed. Not to much over time work, regular
time to time quizzes, labs, programming assignments, etc.
So I've enrolled myself to this [Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2?utm_medium=dashboard)

As a result I wanted to give something back to community. "Get something from community, give back to community" - I always follow this moto. Specially for Java.

I don't want to make money from application that I am now presenting, just to make a presence and to open some doors for
future colleagues.

So here it is:
