# OpenBooksApi


## Introduction


In addition to my Java/Spring expertize and as a proud owner of Android OS smart phone, I was always
tempted to learn and write some application for Android. Year ago I even bought the Android book
[Beginning Android 4 Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-4-Application-Development/dp/1118199545/ref=asap_B001ITVV1E_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1417025391&sr=1-1)
by Wei-Meng Lee.
I was start reading this book couple of times, went over few chapters and as Android programming was not my
primary every-day work, I was loosing focus.
And then I found about Coursera.org. It was just what I needed. Not to much over time work, regular
time to time quizzes, labs, programming assignments, etc.
So I've enrolled myself to this [Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2?utm_medium=dashboard)

And as a result I want to give something back to community. "Get something from community, give back to community" - I always follow this moto. Specially for Java.

I don't want to make money from this application that I am now presenting, just to make a presence and to open some doors for
future colleagues.

So here it is:

## OpenBooksAPI (Android app)

This Android application has two show that I have completed basics of Android development, basic stuff
about:
- how to start and configure Android project
- basic stuff about Android UI (even there is not to much complicated UI elements)
- working with some of the basic concepts of Android development (Activity, Intents, ...)
- working with AndroidManifest.xml file, setting up permissions, ...
- how not to halt main UI thread (AsyncTask, ...) and specially how to make usage of [Volley library](http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html)
- how to sign application APK file and what are the steps to make application available on Google Play Marketplace
